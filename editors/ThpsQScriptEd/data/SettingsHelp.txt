Import section
this section rules affect decompilation of binary QB files

* Apply cosmetic fixes
Automatically adds new line between endscript/script pair and consecutive }{ pair

* Prefer tab for nesting
TAB will be used instead of space

* Uppercase keywords
Prefer "scripts" instead of "SCRIPTS"

* Show Angle values in degrees
This setting affects Angle value of NodeArray, instead of radians it will use degrees (180* instead of 3.1415)

* Round angles (may lose precision)
Forces Round func on the degree value, effectively rounding it to the supposedly intended (180,000000001 to just 180).
However, in some cases it may slightly adjust the original value.

* Fix incorrect checksums
Some user created files may contain custom hex edited checksum values that do not correspond to the actual checksum.
If you want to edit such file, it's recommended to keep this function disabled.
If you are sure the checksum is only used in this single file, you can safely use this option to fix the checksum.
However, if wrong checksum is used across different QB files, you'll have to identify all files that use it and reexport.
Keep in mind, sometimes people may do it intentionaly to .
If you only work with Neversoft files or your own scripts, keep this enabled to validate your checksums and avoid errors.


* Use short new line symbol
Neversoft privided 2 new line symbols:
0x01 considered to be a debug newline, contains current position in the stream saved as int value
0x02 a shorter 1 byte newline, used by default in later games
0x02 is more forgiving than 0x01 in thps3 (for example arrays have problems with 0x01 newlines), hence it is recommended
to keep this option always on. As a side effect it also generates smaller files.

* Save symbols in a separate file
Will dump symbols an extra *.symbols.qb file

* Remove trailing line feeds
Binary file will not keep the original line feed structure and replace trailing new line with just a single one.

* Backup Q sources
Enables backup mechanism - every compilation creates a backup of source code alongside the original file.

* Always load Q source if available
Checks and loads Q file, even if QB was provided. Helps to keep comments in code.


* Scripts folder
Sets current scripts folder.

* External editor
Sets external text editor, Notepad++ recommended. Anything that launches as "editor.exe" "file" will work.
